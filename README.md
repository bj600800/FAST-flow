FAST-flow
**F**unctional **A**ssessment, **S**creening and **T**esting **Workflow** for enzymes

## Background
Protein function prediction is considered the Holy Grail of structural biology, aiming to directly infer protein function from sequence and 3D-structure. Algorithms for enzyme function screening and design have been developed over several decades, resulting in the creation of thousands of distinct methods. However, the rapid pace of algorithm advancement, coupled with a lack of comprehensive classification and comparison, has significantly limited the effective integration of these tools into life sciences research. A well-organized knowledge base that categorizes and reviews these algorithms is essential for facilitating their practical use and advancing enzyme function prediction.

## Motivation
⭐ **Centralized Resource**: Provide streamlined access to diverse enzyme function screening and design tools, enhancing research efficiency.

⭐ **Encourage Innovation**: Inspire new ideas and approaches by showcasing available methodologies and their applications.

⭐ **Bridge Bench and Silicon Research**: Facilitate collaboration between computational scientists and experimental biochemists.

## Results
We have summarized cutting-edge algorithms in the field of enzyme function research, categorizing them into six main types: enzyme function classification, catalytic kinetic parameter prediction, solubility prediction, folding stability prediction, thermal stability prediction, and hybrid methods. For each algorithm, we collected seven relevant pieces of information: method name, description of method characteristics, algorithm type, dataset, citation, code repository, and online server availability. We hope that FAST-flow, this comprehensive knowledge base, will meet the algorithmic needs of researchers in this field, thereby facilitating their endeavors in enzyme research.
